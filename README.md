Image recongnition AI that I trained and wrote, Has a GUI which you can launch using python3. 
Is able to identify aeroplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and trucks to 96% accuracy using the CIFAR dataset. 
This can be made more accurate but I currently don't have the time to train the model further.
